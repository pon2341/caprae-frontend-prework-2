**Position applied:** Frontend Developer

## Overview
This repository contains my submission for Caprae Capital's Frontend Developer pre-work. The project includes:
- Buyer and Seller onboarding workflows
- Buyer profile cards + expanded profile UI
- End-to-end acquisition process UI, addressing major friction points
- Proposed AI features (document analyzer, deal risk scorer, smart checklist)
- Exported design deliverables (PDF / PNG) and a small static prototype

## Deliverables

## Key Features & Rationale
1. **Onboarding (buyer / seller)** — split flows, progressive disclosure, skip & save drafts, trust score indicators.
2. **Buyer card at-a-glance** — revenue, industry, acquisition intent, funding availability, preferred deal size, verified badges, quick action buttons (Accept / Reject / Ask question).
3. **Expanded buyer profile** — financial summary, acquisition history, key contacts, timeline, soft-compatibility score.
4. **Acquisition workflow** — guided checklist, milestone tracking, async document exchange, automated reminders, escrow + KPI dashboard.
5. **AI integrations** — document analyzer & summarizer, negotiation assistant (message suggestions), deal risk scoring, auto-generated LOI drafts.
